// Firestore security rules tailored to the project's schema.
// Collections used by the app:
//  - shops        (owned by a user, visible to everyone)
//  - profiles     (one document per user)
//  - roles        (maps user IDs to roles such as "admin")
//
// Admin functionality in the client relies on an `admin` custom claim
// being set on the user's ID token. You can also manage roles via the
// `roles` collection but rules cannot query across collections, so
// the easiest approach is to add a custom claim when you promote a user.
